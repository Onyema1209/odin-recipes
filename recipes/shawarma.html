    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>shawarma my best recipes, popular Middle Eastern dish that originated in the 
        Ottoman Empire, consisting of meat cut into thin slices, stacked in a cone-like shape, 
        and roasted on a slowly-turning vertical rotisserie or spit, 
        this is my best recipes so far.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken breasts (de-boned or boneless)</li>
        <li>Chicken thighs/laps (de-boned or boneless)</li>
        <li>Shawarma bread (pita bread or tortilla wraps)</li>
        <li>Small cabbage</li>
        <li>Medium sized carrots (grated or cut into thin strips)</li>
        <li>1 large cucumber (cut into thin strips and circles)</li>
        <li>2 big tomatoes (cut into thin strips)</li>
        <li>1 medium sized onion (cut into thin strips)</li>
        <li>Ketchup</li>
        <li>Mayonnaise</li>
        <li>Vegetable or olive oil (for frying)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the spices together in a bowl. 
            Use a medium-sized plastic bowl for mixing 
            together the garlic powder, paprika, nutmeg, cardamon, 
            and cinnamon. Stir the spices for at least 30 seconds 
            so you have fully mixed them together
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the chicken strips to the mixture and toss them 
            before drizzling them with the olive oil. 
            Just place the chicken strips into the spice mixture 
            and toss them until they have been covered with the 
            spice mixture on both sides. Then, drizzle them with 
            a bit of olive oil and toss them again to make sure that 
            they are fully coated in the olive oil and spice mixture.
        </li>
        <li>
            Prepare your grill. Heat your grill and grease a large piece of 
            aluminum foil. Set it on the grill with the greased 
            side up once the grill is heated.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place the spiced chicken onto the foil. Turn the chicken 
            over a few times, until cooked through. 
            This should take about 8 minutes on each side, 
            depending on the size of the chicken strips. 
            If your grill is smaller, you may have to grill the chicken in 2 batches.
        </li>
        <li>Remove the chicken from the grill and place on a serving platter. 
            You'll need to do this before you can begin to assemble your shawarma.
        </li>
        <li>
            Wrap your chicken in the flatbread with the other ingredients. 
            You can add lettuce, onion, tahini sauce, pickled cabbage, hummus, 
            or whatever other ingredients you’d like to place in the flatbread.
             Place the chicken in the bread first, followed by the other toppings,
              pouring on the tahini sauce last. Wrap the flatbread similarly 
              to a burrito, leaving an inch of space between the ingredients and 
              the top of the bread so they don’t pour out. Once you do that,
               your chicken shawarma will be ready to eat!
