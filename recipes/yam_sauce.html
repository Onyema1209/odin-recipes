   <h3>Description</h3>
    <p> We make a sauce for yam, vegetable sauce for rice, 
        and even fried yam/plantain sauce. Basically all tomato sauce 
        follows the same preparation procedure, sometimes I decide to add vegetables. 
        The images below are different tomato sauce made in the “Nigeria Kitchen”,
         In case you haven’t learned about the project ‘Nigeria Kitchen’;Well, 
         it’s my own kitchen where most of the images you see here are made        
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>tomatoes (chopped)</li>
        <li>crayfish (optional)</li>
        <li>maggi(seasoning) (1 cube)</li>
        <li>pepper</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>groundnut oil. (100ml)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Sometimes I chose to spice up with 1 or two eggs
            Here is how to make yam (tomato) sauce in Nigeria;
             you can either blend or chop the tomatoes/fresh pepper 
             and onions to bits, this will affect the appearance of 
             the sauce at the end of the day.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat your frying pan and add about 10cl of groundnut oil 
            heat for about two minutes then add sliced onions fry and stir 
            for a minute then add the ground tomatoes and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook and stir till the tomato is boiling with oil without 
            traces of water(about 15 minutes) you need to stir occasionally 
            to avoid burning
            Add other ingredients – maggi(seasoning) ground crayfish, 
            salt, cook for 5 to 10 minutes and add the vegetable(optional)
             Now that is how to cook Nigerian stew for yam or 
             some people just call it yam sauce
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve with cooked white yam and maybe a bottle 
            of your favorite soft drink, I prefer “CHI” products
        </li>
    </ol>
