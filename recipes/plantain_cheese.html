    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>   Fried Sweet Plantains make the perfect side dish for African 
        and Latin meals or a wonderful snack all by itself. 
        They are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. 
        Sooo good with rice & beans, stews, or a replacement 
        for tostadas! Amazingly delicious!  
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ to 1 tablespoon oil or butter</li>
        <li>1 to 1 ½ ripe plantains per person – depending 
            on the size of the plantain and how hungry you are</li>
        <li>½ cup of grated mozzarella cheese per person</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>  Peel the plantains. Cut off both tips of a plantain then
             cut a line across the ridges of a plantain then 
             lift the skin from the cut portion and 
             remove the entire skin with your hands.
        </li>
        <li>
            Slice the plantains into chips using 
            a mandoline slicer, the slicing side of a box grater 
            or just cut thinly with a knife
        </li>
        <li>
            In a small bowl, mix a quarter cup of water and the salt. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place oil in a deep pan up to 4 inches high. Heat the oil 
            on high for about 10 minutes (the oil should be 350 degrees 
            Fahrenheit hot). Turn down the heat to medium then add 
            two tablespoons of the salt water. Add the plantains 
            one after the other. (I added half of the plantains at this point.) 
        </li>
        <p>Gently stir the plantains and let them fry in the oil while you stir 
            from time to time for about 5 minutes. After that, remove the chips 
            and place on paper towel to absorb excess oil.
        </p>
        <li>
            Once the chips are cold, enjoy! You can store plantain chips 
            in an airtight container or Ziploc bag.
        </li>
    </ol>
